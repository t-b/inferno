    This script uses cx_freeze to convert inferno into an exe file.
    It then wraps it up with README.md and LICENSE and example configs
    And puts it in a single folder, the source (ie all the scripts)
    will be placed in ./src/ inside the folder. All will be zipped and
    a version appended.
